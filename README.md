# Mapty
A website for keeping records of your workouts on a map. This project was developed as an exercise in Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course. 

Instruction:

1. Download the files in the repository and put them in the same folder.
2. Open index.html in your preferred browser.

Functionality:

To add a workout record click anywhere on the map and fill the following form. To see a logged workout on a map click on the corresponding sidebar entry.
The entries are stored in the local storage, so you can come back anytime and start where you left off.

Added:
You can edit or delete any entry, as well as sort the workouts based on a variety of criterias or delete all workouts altogether.
The form also features more realistic wrong input messages as opposed to simple alerts suggested in the exercise.
Also fixed several bugs with entries loaded from the local storage.
Those are things I've done myself outside of the exercise.
